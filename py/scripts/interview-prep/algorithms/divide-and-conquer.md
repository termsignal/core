# Divide and Conquer


Divide and Conquer is an algorithmic paradigm. A typical Divide and Conquer algorithm solves a problem using following three steps.

1. **Divide** : Break the given problem into subproblems of same type.
2. **Conquer** : Recursively solve these subproblems
3. **Combine** : Appropriately combine the answers

A classic example of Divide and Conquer is [Merge Sort](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/merge-sort/) demonstrated below. In Merge Sort, we divide array into two halves, sort the two halves recursively, and then merge the sorted halves.
