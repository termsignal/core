# Heap Data Structure


A Heap is a special Tree-based data structure in which the tree is a complete binary tree. Generally, Heaps can be of two types:

1. **Max-Heap** : In a Max-Heap the key present at the root node must be greatest among the keys present at all of it’s children. The same property must be recursively true for all sub-trees in that Binary Tree.
2. **Min-Heap** : In a Min-Heap the key present at the root node must be minimum among the keys present at all of it’s children. The same property must be recursively true for all sub-trees in that Binary Tree.
