# Missing Ranges

You are given an inclusive range `[lower, upper]` and a **sorted unique** integer array `nums`, where all elements are in the inclusive range.

A number `x` is considered **missing** if `x` is in the range `[lower, upper]` and `x` is not in `nums`.

Return *the **smallest sorted** list of ranges that **cover every missing number exactly*** . That is, no element of `nums` is in any of the ranges, and each missing number is in one of the ranges.

Each range `[a,b]` in the list should be output as:

* `"a->b"` if`a != b`
* `"a"` if`a == b`

## First Approach

#### Approach 1: Linear Scan

**Intuition and Algorithm**

Since the input array, `nums`, is sorted ascendingly and all the elements in it are within the given `[lower, upper]` bounds, we can simply check consecutive elements to see if they differ by one or not. If they don't, then we have found a missing range.

* When`nums[i] - nums[i-1] == 1`, we know that there are no missing elements between`nums[i-1]` and`nums[i]`.
* When`nums[i] - nums[i-1] > 1`, we know that the range of elements,`[nums[i-1] + 1, nums[i] - 1]`, is missing

However, there are two edge cases:

* Edge case 1: If we don't start with`lower` as the first element of the array, we will need to include`[lower, num[0] - 1]` as a missing range as well.![](https://leetcode.com/problems/missing-ranges/Figures/163/2.png)
* Edge case 2: Similarly, if we don't end with`upper` as the last element of the array, we will need to include`[nums[n-1] + 1, upper]` as a missing range as well. Note`n` here is the length of the input array,`nums`.

```python

class Solution:
    def findMissingRanges(self, nums: List[int], lower: int, upper: int) -> List[str]:
        # formats range in the requested format
        def formatRange(lower, upper):
            if lower == upper:
                return str(lower)
            return str(lower) + "->" + str(upper)

        result = []
        prev = lower - 1
        for i in range(len(nums) + 1):
            curr = nums[i] if i < len(nums) else upper + 1
            if prev + 1 <= curr - 1:
                result.append(formatRange(prev + 1, curr - 1))
            prev = curr
        return result

```


**Complexity Analysis**

Let N be the length of the input array.

* Time complexity : O(N)
* **This is because we are only iterating over the array once, and at each step, we're performing O(1)** operations. We treat the string building as O(1) because the strings can never be more than a fixed size.
* Space complexity : O(1)**The output list has a worst case size of O(N). This case occurs when we have a missing range between each of the consecutive elements in the input array (for example, if the input array contains all*even* numbers between `lower` and `upper`). We aren't using any other additional space, beyond fixed-sized constants that don't grow with the size of the input.**However** , output space that is simply used to return the output (and not to do any processing) is not counted for the purpose of space complexity analysis. For this reason, the overall space complexity is O(1)**
